                            Version 1, April 2016 

                    Copyright (C) 2016 Cooper Pellaton 

      Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim or modified 
      copies of this license document, and changing it is allowed as long 
      as the name is changed. 


                              Statement of Purpose
Humans evolved in small communities based on cooperation and local enforcement of social mores.
Antisocial behavior was punished by the community through ostracization or corporal punishment. 
The emergence of globe-spanning empires and conglomerates, along with the legal systems that have
sprouted in their shade have supplanted personal justice, and replaced it with a system of courts,
lawyers, appeals, lubricated by money and weighted in favor of amoral multinational corporations who
use their massive political influence to create a system that concentrates wealth and power in the
hands of a tiny percentage of people.

This license is designed to cut through the legal bullshit that permeates every facet of our daily
lives, and replace it with a simple covenant between two people, the Author and the User. Using the
Author's time, talent, and ideas, this work has been created and made available to all to copy
modify, and distribute. In return, the User may not, in any capacity, be a fucking asshole to the
Author.


                      CROSS ME & YOU'RE FUCKED PUBLIC LICENSE 
          TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION 
Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and
associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal in the Software without restriction,
including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute,
sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is
furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:

  At all times, proper attribution must be provided. The User may do whatever the fuck she desires
  to the "Software" but proper attribution and therefore respect must be lent to the Author. 
  Failure to provide such attribution in any form (a link, a name or simply a dank meme nodding 
  it's head at the Author) is to be interpreted as intentional malice brought against the Author.

  Most importantly, do not, by any means, attempt to fuck the Author. Redistribution or use without
  crediting the Author is considering attempting to "fuck" the Author. Breaking the "Software" in
  the Author's repository at any point is considered "fucking" with the Author. Be a good person, 
  do not fuck the Author.

  The person responsible for determining whether they have been fucked, and therefore crossed, is
  the Author.

  When the Author has been crossed, defined as the User attempting to, or succeeding in "fucking"
  the Author, the Author reserves the right to fuck the User. If you cross the Author, you are
  fucked. To fuck the User means that all access, privilege, and rights to future software to 
  be written by the Author will be revoked. Additionally, the Author reserves the right to 
  harm the User physically if the two ever meet away from keyboard.

  Such physical retaliation may be, but is not limited to, punching in the face.


                                            TL;DR
In short, after reading this license agreement it should be clear that the User can do whatever the
fuck she wants with the Software so long as she is a civil human being. Essentially:
  Do not be a dick and make me punch you in the face.
